# Choose Your Own Adventure: The Solar System

Choose Your Own Adventure: The Solar System is a web-based choose your own adventure game with an educational component. 

Players will be guided through a series of questions. They can choose one answer for each question, and based on the answer they choose, a story about an adventure through the solar system will be crafted for them. 

Along the way, they will see animations and learn facts about the solar system, related to their place in the story. At the end, they will be directed to a "results" page, where they can read a story designed for them based on the questions and answers they chose.
