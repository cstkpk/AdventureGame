You masterfully constructed the ship, and when you climbed aboard and booted up the computer, a message flashed across the screen, welcoming you to your mission. Then, before you could think, the engines fired up and the ship took off! What an exciting start to your day!"

It even tried to placate you by sharing a parable about why people say the moon is made of cheese, but it seems that you woke up on the wrong side of the bed today... and you decided that you only wanted to visit the moon if it were made of cheese. So the ship took you home. What a way to end an adventure before it begins!"

You even learned that the dark side of the moon is a myth: both sides of the moon get the same amount of sunlight, but we on Earth only see one side of the moon. It takes the moon the same amount of time to rotate around on its axis as it does for it to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side of the moon is always facing Earth."

You explored the surface in your extra durable spacesuit and learned about the craters on its surface. Mercury is the most cratered planet in our entire solar system! Unlike most other planets, which 'self-heal' through geological processes, Mercury's surface is covered in craters, old and new. The largest crater on Mercury is called the Caloris Basin. It is about 1,550 km wide and was discovered in 1974 by the Mariner probe."

It was once thought that Venus might be a tropical paradise, but once radio mapping was developed in the 1960s, scientists were able to measure the extreme temperatures and pressures. Venus's dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide traps heat and causes a greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Its atmospheric pressure is so high that it crushes any asteroids before they even make impact with the surface. It's a good thing you decided not to attempt any landings!"

Then you remembered that there are signs of liquid water on Mars! Scientists have discoverd water on Mars in the form of ice. In satellite images, we can see signs of trickling water as dark stripes or stains on cliffs and crater walls. However, this water would have to be salty, or else it would freeze or vaporize due to Mars's thin atmosphere. Could the mysterious creatures who sent you on this mission once have lived here?"

Even though Mars has a thin atmosphere, it still creates wind, and when these winds pick up the fine, dry dust particles of Mars's surface, they can create enormous dust storms. These storms can last for days and reach wind speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour! Sometimes, the storms can get so large that they cover the entire planet in dust for weeks. It looks like you'll have to wait a while before you can continue on your journey!"

While passing by the planet, you got a spectacular view of its Great Red Spot, a storm so large that the Earth could fit inside of it three times over. Good thing you decided not to take a closer look; it would have swallowed you whole!"
